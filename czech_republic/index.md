Travel notes on Czech Republic
==============================

## General information

Many czech people don't speak English, especially outside Praha and the main cities. I took a train between Praha and Linz (Austria) and I had to stop in a small czech city, to take a bus because of works on the line. On a Sunday, there wasn't anybody in this place, and noone was able to speak English.

Regional trains are not very comfortable, but fast trains, on main railways, are very comfortable and quite cheap.


## Praha

Indications at Praha main station are a bit messy. Note that the main station is actually composed of two buildings, which are some minutes far by walking, so be sure to head to the right one.

Note also that although Praha has a bus station, many buses, especially for connections to main cities in Germany and Austria are leaving from the central train station.
