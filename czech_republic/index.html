<h2 id="general-information">General information</h2>
<p>Many czech people don’t speak English, especially outside Praha and the main cities. I took a train between Praha and Linz (Austria) and I had to stop in a small czech city, to take a bus because of works on the line. On a Sunday, there wasn’t anybody in this place, and noone was able to speak English.</p>
<p>Regional trains are not very comfortable, but fast trains (Pendolinos), on main railways, are very comfortable and quite cheap.</p>
<h2 id="praha">Praha</h2>
<p>Indications at Praha main station are a bit messy. Note that the main station is actually composed of two buildings, which are some minutes far by walking, so be sure to head to the right one.</p>
<p>Note also that although Praha has a bus station, many buses, especially for connections to main cities in Germany and Austria are leaving from the central train station.</p>
