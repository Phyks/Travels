Travel notes on Belgium
=======================

## Brussels

Always buy your train ticket in the country of departure. For instance, if you travel from Paris to Brussels with Thalys, buy your ticket at SNCF (French company). But if you travel from Brussels to Paris, buy it at SNCB (Belgium company). If you buy a SNCF ticket from Brussels to Paris, you will have to print it before, for example (or to pay 10â‚¬ to print it at Brussels station).
