<h2 id="paris">Paris</h2>
<p>When you want to connect from Paris center and the airports, a general advice would be to always take the local train service, RER, which is usually way faster than buses. In fact, there can be big traffic jams which won’t affect it. Air France buses are very expensive, and RATP (local public transport) buses and RER have similar prices (~ 10€).</p>
<p>Note that the terminal 2G at Paris CDG is very far from the public transports and you have to take a special bus to connect between terminal 2F and 2G, so take some extra time. Usually, you have power plugs and free wifi in the two parisians airports.</p>
<h2 id="lyon">Lyon</h2>
<p>The ticket to go from the airport to the central train station (La Pardieu) is quite expensive (about 15€).</p>
